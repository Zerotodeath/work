<p><strong>Careers in Technology</strong></p>
<p>If you scored over 60% in this technology career category, you likely enjoy using computers or other technology devices. You may be the first person to want the latest smartphone, smartwatch, or wireless device. You probably also like using the internet to find information.</p>
<p>The good news is, technology is a growing field with many career options and opportunities. Many careers in tech today weren't even around 20 years ago! Tech careers are often fast-growing occupations because companies leverage technology to do business like never before. People also embrace technology to make their lives easier, from shopping online, adjusting the temperature, and turning on lights with just a voice command. People even monitor their health and track their activity using wearable technology.</p>
<p><strong>If you haven't graduated high school yet:</strong></p>
<p>Now is the ideal time to explore what the technology field is all about. In high school, you want to take challenging math classes. If math is not your strongest subject, don't fret. Place effort in your math studies and work to gain a solid foundation in Algebra. Algebra is often a pre-requisite to take a college-level Intro to Programming course. Your summer breaks in high school can also be a great time to learn to code, providing you a glimpse into whether you may love a career in tech or not.</p>
<p>Did you know there are college summer camps (though most cater to students who have yet to graduate high school)? Colleges recruit future students this way. They offer pre-college programs that introduce essential topics such as web design and development, data analytics, and how to present data. Volunteer and internship opportunities are another way to gain experience.</p>
<p>Check if any local non-profits in your area may need entry-level help and tell them you're interested in anything technology related. Aside from college summer camps, volunteering, and internship opportunities, you may also try and land an entry-level, part-time job in the technology field that requires little experience. These positions can help you gain real-world experience in the field while you earn an income. </p>
<p><strong>Free Coding Resources:</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are a student or adult, there are a ton of free online resources to help you learn today. A list of our favorites include <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0" target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a>, and <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science" target="_blank">HarvardX's free Intro to Computer Science course</a> on EDx.org. The HarvardX course is most appropriate for high school students and adults. However, if you are younger and motivated to stick with it, you can take the course HarvardX course, too!</p>
<p><strong>Choosing a Technology Career:</strong></p>
<p>Though a college degree is not required to land a career in tech, most jobs in technology require some formal education and training.  If salary is a motivating factor for you, research technology careers requiring 2-years of college or more to complete. However, many employers of higher-paying technology careers are looking for candidates with at least a bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>To narrow down your career search by education level, visit the Careers section on this site and choose the Technology category. From there, filter the list by the education level you are willing to attain. When researching careers, you'll not only learn what education is required, but you also want to check out what the job entails, the growth rate, and the salary you can expect after graduation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has a useful <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/" target="_blank">Occupational Handbook</a> to research this information.</p>
<p>If you want to launch your career quickly, research certification programs you can complete in one year or a few months. Community colleges and trade schools specialize in these programs and generally have information right on their website. It is essential to know that certifications will not qualify you for a Pell Grant, and you may need to fund the cost another way. The school's financial aid office should be able to discuss options with you. If you do need help paying for tuition, you may want to look at a two-year associate's degree program as you could qualify for the Pell Grant when you complete a <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa/" target="_blank">FAFSA application</a>.</p>
<p>Two-year associate's degree programs allow you to enter the workforce faster and continue your education online to earn your bachelor's degree if you so choose. However, if you can commit four years to earn your bachelor's degree, you can unlock significantly more career options.</p>
<p>But college isn't the only route to gain a career in technology. Each branch of the military has positions in technology as well. If considering the military, know you can also join the military reserve and go to college at the same time. Each branch of the military offers appealing tuition reimbursement programs and pays a stipend to those who go to college.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing a Degree or Certification Program:</strong></p>
<p>A computer science degree is one of the most versatile technology degrees. This degree trains you to program, analyze data, and create data visualizations. It provides you with the skills necessary to specialize in other areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, cybersecurity and ethical hacking, or Big Data. According to DataUSA.io, the average wage of someone with a computer science degree is close to $100,000 a year.</p>
<p>The career fields with the most computer science degrees were software developers, computer programmers, and computer and information systems managers. Other more specialized positions included computer and information research scientists, information security analysts, and software quality assurance analysts and testers. For all technology career descriptions, check our <a href="https://www.yourfreecareertest.com/career-research/technology-media-careers/">Technology Careers</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>Work Environment:</strong></p>
<p>Many people in tech work indoors and at an office. However, because of technology's easy access, many can perform their jobs from home. Service technicians may work on-the-road and visit site locations. Hours can vary, but most work 40 hours a week. Sometimes, overtime or weekend work is necessary to meet project deadlines or convert technology systems during off-peak hours. Workers sometimes elect to work from a standing desk to avoid sitting at a computer for long periods. Depending on the type of technology career you choose, you may also connect, assemble, or take apart technology devices which requires a bit more physical activity.</p>

<p><strong>How to Choose an Art Program:</strong></p>
<p>Next, you'll want to consider whether or not you wish to enroll in an art program. There are many art colleges to choose from, and you may struggle to find the right fit. It can be helpful to consider the type of art program you are most interested in and research colleges that focus on that field of study.</p>
<p>For example, some art schools focus more on the performing arts than the visual arts. Other programs are well known for their music program. Still others, maybe world renown for their focused art conservation program. No matter the field of study you're interested in, you also want to choose a school and location that can inspire you as an artist so you can be your most creative, inspired self.</p>
<p>If you are considering a college art program, research various art school's admission requirements now to find out exactly what their application requirements are. They may ask for a portfolio, and each program may have different requirements.</p>

<p>Now, if you have yet to graduate high school, look for ways to develop your artistic talent. High school is a great time to learn about different mediums and explore various ways to express yourself artistically. While in high school, take your art classes seriously as you'll want to start to build your portfolio. A portfolio will demonstrate your techniques and style to potential clients or art programs. Remember, your collection represents your artistic abilities, and can include photography, drawings, digital media, or other artwork that represents your ability.</p>
<p>To gain hands-on experience, you can look for community opportunities. You can do this by finding local art galleries that may display student artwork, volunteer at art fairs or events, join art clubs, or find community art organizations that are accepting members. These are all excellent ways to network, learn from other artists, or even gain references that you can use on future college admissions or job applications.</p>

<p><strong>Work Environment:</strong></p>
<p>The work environment of an artist varies greatly. If you're a dancer or musician, you'll spend much of your time in studios practicing your craft and then work at venues while you perform. If you are a fine artist, you would often work in an art studio. </p>
<p>If your artwork requires the use of technology to create, you'll likely find yourself at a desk with multiple monitors in front of you while you work. Other artists may require extensive travel, especially in the case of travel photographers or videographers or those who document wildlife.</p>

<p><strong>Careers in Healthcare:</strong></p>
<p>There are many careers to research in healthcare and wellness and a few examples are: sonographer, registered nurse, certified nursing assistant, licensed practical nurse, radiographer, surgical technologist, dental assistant, dental hygienist, physical therapist, physical therapy assistant (and aid), occupational therapist, occupational therapist assistant (and aid), speech therapist, doctor, emergency medical technician, medical assistant, medical records assistant, medical coder and biller, clinical lab tech, veterinarian, medical coder and biller, nutritionist or dietitian, and personal training.</p>
<p>If you scored over 60% on this career test in healthcare, you likely enjoy helping those in need. Friends and family would probably describe you as kind, caring, and empathetic. These are the characteristics of people in the medical field.</p>
<p>Medial professionals help the sick, empower people to make positive changes, educate communities to stay healthy, and research new vaccines and treatments. They may not be miracle workers, but they sure come close. They save lives.</p>
<p>Healthcare workers must have a blend of stamina, determination, and critical thinking to complement their caring nature. However, one of the toughest decisions all healthcare professionals must make is choosing their medical specialty. There are hundreds of medical careers to choose from, but there are a few strategies to narrow down your list of options. First, let's consider education level.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to start your career as soon as possible, research certification programs that require a few months of training, such as Nursing Assistant, Phlebotomy Technician, and Medical Coder and Biller. Other programs take two years to complete, such as imaging technicians, vet technicians, surgical technicians, registered nurses, physical therapy assistants, and dental hygienists. If you can commit four or more years to your education, you can unlock significantly more career options.</p>
<p><strong>Career Research:</strong></p>
<p>Most careers in healthcare require formal education and training. So do your research to ensure your time investment pays off and secures a position you love. The next way to narrow down your list is salary. A good rule of thumb, jobs requiring more education generally pay more too. If salary is a motivating factor for you, research healthcare careers requiring at least 2-years of college or more to complete. Once you determine your education and salary preference, it's time to decide which specialty is right for you.</p>
<p>Check out your other high-interest career categories to discover careers that blend your interests. For example, if you scored high in technology, finance, and healthcare, healthcare informatics may be a career option. If you scored high in healthcare, science, and technology, research what an epidemiologist does. To narrow your search even further, YourFreeCareerTest has a free healthcare career test that asks you questions to determine your interest level across broad healthcare field categories.</p>
<p>Successful healthcare workers must be good at solving problems, often at a moment's notice. People in this field also interact with the public most of the day and must engage with other medical colleagues, so communication and teamwork are crucial for success.</p>
<p>The level of math, science, and technology you must learn in the medical field will vary by position. Some positions require an advanced level of working knowledge, while others require a basic understanding.</p>
<p>If you are still in middle school or high school, consider taking courses in anatomy, biology (and human biology), chemistry, math, physics, and nutrition. Put energy into these subjects so you can be competitive when applying for acceptance into college medical programs.</p>
<p><strong>Work Environment:</strong></p>
<p>A healthcare professional's work environment varies by position. If you are a physical therapist, you may work for a sports team or in a rehab center. Biomedical engineers work in laboratories. Those that care for, test, or treat patients - such as nurses, doctors, or advanced imaging technicians, often see patients in hospitals or other care settings. Not only does your work environment vary by position, but so does your schedule and amount of hours worked. Medical coders and billers may have an average, 40-hour work-week. In contrast, those that work in operating rooms, such as surgeons, O.R. nurses, anesthesiologists, and let's not forget veterinarians, may work longer hours, nights, and weekends.</p>
<p>Some positions require more physical activity than others. However, most require stamina and the ability to stand or walk. But don't rule out a career in healthcare if you do have physical limitations. Research careers in the medical field without consideration of your physical abilities. Then, research various medical settings and specialties that would be flexible to your unique situation.</p>
<p>Again, the education required will depend on the career you choose. If you want to work quickly but continue to advanced your career, there are medical careers for that. For example, you can become a Registered Nurse with a 2-year associate's degree. As you work as a nurse, you can take a blend of online classes and clinical experience to earn your bachelor's degree in nursing. From there, you can become a Nurse Practitioner by earning your master's degree.</p>
<p><strong>Career Outlook:</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the healthcare field is one of the fastest-growing career fields in the United States with some of the highest-paid salaries in the nation.</p>
